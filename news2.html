                        The Intersolar Europe takes place annually at Munich in Germany and is the world’s leading exhibition for the solar industry and its partners. In 2014, 1,082 international exhibitors and 42,380 trade visitors attended the Intersolar Europe. The exhibition focuses on the areas of photovoltaics, PV production technologies, energy storage systems and renewable heating. Since its founding, it has become the most important industry platform for the solar industry. In 2014, more than 1,100 attendees and around 200 speakers discussed current industry topics and shed light on the background of technological, market and political developments.

                        In 2015, the ees Europe, an international exhibition for batteries, energy storage systems and innovative production, takes place for the second time in conjunction with the Intersolar Europe. The ees Europe is covering the entire value chain of innovative battery and energy storage technologies.
                        To be successful, a company has to differentiate itself from the crowd with groundbreaking ideas and technological innovations. The Intersolar strives to promote the industry’s power to innovate. To this end, the ees AWARD was introduced at Intersolar Europe 2014. It honors innovative products and solutions for electrical energy storage, e.g. product components or technical innovations in the fields of materials, production, systems, applications, second use, and recycling.
                        Each year a committee of experts does choose the 10 most innovative products from all applicants as finalists for the award. In this final round the companies are able to present their products in each single detail and also hold an oral presentation at the Intersolar Europe. From these 10 finalists, the committee will choose in an official ceremony on June 10 the 3 winners for 2015.
                        In 2015, also AlphaESS does participate a second time at the Intersolar Europe/ees Europe with 13 specialists and an almost doubled booth size compared to last year, to present our advanced energy storage products. This year AlphaESS also applied for the ees Award and directly enforced itself together with 9 other applicants against more than 100 competitors. The AlphaESS Storion Series was accepted as one of the 10 most innovative products 2015 and shows therefore the AlphaESS’ power to innovate.
                        We look forward to present all interested visitors our innovative products in the open presentation but also individual at our booth B1.220 in hall B1.
