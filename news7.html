                        <p>During June 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup>, Intersolar Europe 2015 was grandly held in Munich, Germany. As the world&#39;s largest and most far-reaching trade show of solar energy, the exhibition attracted more than 1,000 global exhibitors, and a total of more than 40,000 visitors all of the world. Since 2014, another big event --- EES Europe (international exhibition for batteries, energy storage system and innovative production), has been held at the same time and in the same place together with Intersolar Europe exhibition. In recognition of ground-breaking products and solutions in solar field, Intersolar Award and ees awards are announced every year during the exhibition. As the only Chinese company to be nominated for awards EES, Alpha was invited to give the nomination speech in the afternoon on July 10th.

                        <p>The&nbsp;lecture&nbsp;was presented by&nbsp;General Manager&nbsp;of Alpha&nbsp;Germany, Mr. James Xu. First he made a brief introduction of&nbsp;Alpha&#39;s mission,&nbsp;company history since its establishment&nbsp;in 2012&nbsp;and then brought out Alpha’s new lithium&nbsp;storage&nbsp;system “Storion Series” --- S3 (3kw single phase), S5 (5kw single phase), T6 (6kw three phases), as well as separate Powerplug batteries. Storion Series combine EMS LCD touch screens, which is a smart energy management system invented by Alpha itself, hybrid inverters, cable box and batteries modules to make a cabinet for easy movement and installation. Features like versatility, reliability,&nbsp;compatibility, and&nbsp;Alpha&nbsp;cloud, as well as future&nbsp;smart home&nbsp;concept attracted&nbsp;much attention from&nbsp;attendances. &nbsp;Through the&nbsp;lecture,&nbsp;Alpha successfully conveyed its company philosophy of &quot;Smarten Your Energy&quot;&nbsp;to all coming&nbsp;installers,&nbsp;distributors and&nbsp;partners from all over the world.

                        <p>
                            Aquion Energy, Inc. (USA): The panel was impressed by the sustainability and reliability of the new generation of batteries presented by Aquion Energy, Inc. The Aqueous Hybrid Ion (AHI) batteries developed by the American company are suitable for stationary systems in domestic, off-grid and microgrid areas of application, and are almost exclusively made up of environmentally friendly components. A high level of safety is ensured by the use of an electrolyte based on an aqueous sodium sulfate solution. Since the cell temperature does not require monitoring, there is also no need to spend large amounts of money on fire protection and ventilation. What’s more, the battery’s storage capacity remains constant even during extreme fluctuations in temperature. Overall, the panel was convinced that the technology had “the potential to boost efficiency”.

                            KOSTAL Industrie Elektrik GmbH (Germany): The PIKO BA System Li invented by KOSTAL Industrie Elektrik GmbH is a three-phase storage device for private households. It combines an inverter, a lithium battery pack and a current sensor that can determine the household’s current energy demand in real time without the need for a separate battery inverter. Furthermore, the switch box protects the storage system from overvoltage. According to the panel, the durable lithium-ion battery stands out with its “versatility, reliability and modular design”.

                        <p>
                            SOLARWATT GmbH (Germany): With its SOLARWATT MyReserve, the Dresden-based company has designed a modular battery storage system for home owners that is capable of being retrofitted. Featuring DC technology, the product is compatible with all conventional single-phase and three-phase inverters. It can be integrated without interfering with the solar array’s output or communication system. In addition to its simple plug-and-play installation, MyReserve boasts an overall efficiency of 93%, enabling it to transform new and existing PV systems into particularly lucrative investments. The panel concluded: “The device won us over with its high level of energy efficiency as well as its remarkably safe design and ability to be integrated into existing systems.

                            It was a pity that Alpha missed EES award this time. However, Alpha never stops learning from successful pioneers and enhancing its own technical supports. As a matter of fact, Alpha is now growing fast with a young enthusiastic international team across Europe, Australia and mainland China and constantly receive high compliments for its innovative actions. It won’t be long before Alpha becomes one of the industry leaders worldwide.
