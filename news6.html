                            <span>During June 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup>, Intersolar Europe, the world’s leading exhibition the solar industry and its partners, was successfully held in Munich International Exhibition Center. This year over 1000 companies gathered together&nbsp;to present their products and services, providing in-depth insights into current market and technological trends. There was a slightly shrink in the overall size compared to last year; energy storage section in Hall B1, however, was unprecedentedly popular.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>With new storage and battery family --- Storion Series S3 (3kw single phase), S5 (5kw single phase), T6 (6kw three phases), and Powerplug battery, Alpha-ESS showed itself in the exhibition the second time since last year. S3, S5 and T6 are all equipped with EMS LCD touch screens, a smart energy management system invented by Alpha. The systems are highly compatible with multiple inverters and batteries. Visualized screens make it easy for users to monitor system operation status via online program and mobile APPs. Also both EMS and BMS firmware can be easily updated by a single USB port or by yourself for free. All the three systems have two options of battery type—M4850 (48V 50Ah) and M4860 (48V 60Ah) to meet different customer requirements. For users who already have inverters or other related facilities, Powerplug is equally striking with plug-and-play function and high compatibility. </span>

                        <p>
                            <span>As the only Chinese company in the first echelon, Alpha-ESS stood together with LG, BMW, BENTS, TESLA, etc to give the audience a solar feast. High-tech products, well-designed booth and young international team had brought Alpha constant attention and exciting feedback. During the exhibition, Alpha received guests from over 40 countries and regions, and talked with over 400 installers, distributors and partners all over the world. Based on the market share Alpha quickly seized since its establishment two years ago, and thanks to the widespread attention Alpha gained during Intersolar, we now have every reason to believe Alpha is going to open up a vast world in this explosively growing industry soon.</span>
