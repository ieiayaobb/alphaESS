                    Thanks to Tesla’s unveiling of the Tesla PowerWall this week the spotlight has been firmly place
                    onto the domestic energy storage industry. Back from exhibiting our own Energy Storage Systems at
                    [insert exhibition name] it is refreshing to see that AlphaESS’s vision for the future of domestic
                    power is mimicked in a wider audience.

                    AlphaESS welcomes newcomers to the industry. Growing awareness of Solar Energy Storage and its place
                    in the household will only greater achieve our goals to create a future where millions can become
                    energy independent. AlphaESS envisages the next generation of SmartHomes to be

                    Tesla’s decision to diversify its range away from the motor industry is strategically crucial. The
                    revenue generated by Tesla has been consistently high since flotation in 2010 however profit hasn’t
                    reflected that. Large competition with well-established companies in the automotive arena and new
                    self-generation incentives from the State of Californian likely contributed to Tesla’s impression
                    that the energy storage industry is a short-term solution.

                    AlphaESS has, since its inception in 2012, produced and distributed Energy Storage Solutions for
                    Photovoltaic systems. Currently operating in Europe and Australia AlphaESS has built up a quality
                    reputation with customers and within the industry being nominated for ees AWARD finalist before
                    Intersolar Exhibition in Munich this June. As such at AlphaESS we feel qualified and obligated to
                    comment on changes in the industry landscape.

                    At first look, the design of Tesla’s PowerWall is very appealing. With the use of high energy
                    density batteries the PowerWall has been made very compact. The wall mount design offers obvious
                    advantages in situations of limited floor space.

                    Electricity storage in automobiles and domestic storage prioritises different aspects. Much more
                    importance is given to both safety and lifetime in the domestic setting.

                <p>
                    Safety:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having a storage system inside a home as apposed to in an automobile brings about a change in user
                    perspective. In a home environment the user is not in a sense of alertness as with driving and is
                    more reliant on a system functioning in a safe manner. Tesla’s use of Lithium NMC batteries in its
                    PowerWall seems to stem from a design point of view. Lithium NMC batteries have a high energy
                    density and therefore the PowerWall can be made more compact. The use of &nbsp;Lithium NMC has been
                    directly taken from the batteries used in Tesla cars simply for the reason of capacitance. However
                    in terms of safety the use of Lithium NMC is considered to be less safe than other cell types
                    namely, Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP). Used in AlphaESS products LFP is considered the safest form of
                    Lithium battery available a point for which AlphaESS sacrificed on energy density, least important
                    for domestic energy storage .

                <p>
                    Lifetime:
                </p>

                <p>
                    The two aspects of lifetime are considered separately, calendar life and cycle life. The upper end
                    unit 10 kWh allows a continuous power discharge of 2 kW. Curiously low power considering the
                    expected power usage of a home in evenings is more close to 3&nbsp;kW. This application can be
                    considered as a compromise of power to gain a longer cycle life, but the battery can’t discharge
                    enough energy that could have supported the load. This would greatly reduce the system revenue
                    because the loss overweighs the gain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                    With respect to calendar life of the batteries used, the choice of 18650 batteries seems again from
                    a design perspective, logical, however when considering 18650 Lithium NMC give a maximum of 10 Wh
                    energy units then this requires more than 1000 batteries per unit, decreasing reliability.
                    Individually these cells will have a long lifetime but even then a claimed 10 years from Tesla seems
                    very ambitious.

                    End user considerations:

                <p>
                    Taking customer needs into account Tesla have chosen a design in terms of modulation but have
                    decided to use modules of 7 or 10 kWh. Randomly taking UK for example, when the average household
                    consumes near 14.5 kWh per day, increase storage in such large steps becomes impractical and
                    inflexible. AlphaESS uses a modular design by collaborating modules of 2.5 or 3.5 kWh modules housed
                    in one unit. This gives great flexibility to the end user and allows bespoke fitting to the needs in
                    different households.

                <p>
                    Modules need to act as one unit once installed, a master modular needs to be assigned to the system
                    by means of an energy management system a system also used to view performance of the unit as a
                    whole. AlphaESS has developed a web enabled energy management system with LCD touch screen. The
                    system allows remote monitoring of operation optimising effectiveness of the photovoltaics. The
                    energy management system acts as the nerve centre of the system whereby it automatically assigns
                    master module, can identify and predict peak usage and identify problems that arise. Master modules
                    assignment and problem identification can be done remotely, reducing the need for engineer callout.
                    Peak usage can be predicted by big data collection from many units and this can be then used to feed
                    power back to the grid a high demand times and therefore increase profitability for the user.

                    Tesla’s arrival in the industry is seen as a positive move for the whole industry, bringing
                    awareness and ability to impact public opinion is something to be admired. We at AlphaESS are proud
                    that our vision for the future can be shared by so many and that this new spotlight will attract new
                    talents, drive growth and allow our vision to become reality.&nbsp;
